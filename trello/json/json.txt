Some of the work she was supporting has gone away and she is considering new roles as her current work has become slow and stagnant. She very much enjoys the Agile fast paced environments she’s worked in before.

I came across this job requisition and wanted to reach out to you to find out more details if possible.  I recently joined SRA / CSRA on 11/2/15 and I’m currently on a contract.  However, there is a real possibility that the Task Orders I am slated to manage might not get funded.  I’m currently managing several smaller projects and lending a hand in whatever capacity that our Program Manager needs me to as there is plenty to do.  I am not actively looking for new positions but might if the funding for these task orders does not get approved. \n  \nWhat sparked my interest about the US Courts position was the opportunity for Agile Transformation, the subject material, and the location.  I actually did a phone screen for US Courts with an SRA Manager named Clifton about 6 months ago via Apex who was shopping my resume at that time.  It turned out that an internal candidate was chosen for that PM position but he asked if I would be interested in a ScrumMaster position as we both enjoyed the interview.  While I could perform that position it would be a step back professionally to take a ScrumMaster only position.  I was very interested in SRA / US Courts at the time but had to decline to pursue the position as I wanted to continue on the PM track I have been on for the last 9 years. \n  \nIf you have time I would like to find out more about the position and any other details if possible.  I appreciate discretion at this time as I don’t want to unnecessarily raise any concerns with my current Management.   \n  \nThank you, \n  \nTodd Davis – PMP, CSM, SAFe SPMPO\nSr. Project Manager | Department of Homeland Security\nSRA International | 202 487 3243 \nTodd.Davis@csra.com","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","idList":"569431b6331b08db840f9298","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":24,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["569431b6331b08db840f929c","569431b6331b08db840f92b6","569431b6331b08db840f92c4","569431b6331b08db840f92c9","569431b6331b08db840f92cb","569431b6331b08db840f92c6","569431b6331b08db840f92cf","56bce1a6152c3f92fdf720ab","56bce5bd152c3f92fdf73472","569431b6331b08db840f92d1"],"name":"(SRA) Todd Davis","pos":229376,"shortLink":"OWF7NoNB","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":true,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":19,"checkItemsChecked":19,"comments":21,"attachments":2,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"pradeepchilka+53f48283f9a66d78300ddf0b+56a8e65b873927f828876c9c+5e4219407384088b18349f5ccb951821a829d832@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":["56a94a6a045d5c69a650b9e0","56abce7f2884aa6d7c7779cc","56b8be1819b33d316ca2ed0b","56ba3e5c9a3e7c4a137e5ff1"],"idMembers":["564349146656f8b20167c752","55db16a6567be917b91b8614","53f48283f9a66d78300ddf0b"],"labels":[{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f929c","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Job::PM","color":"pink","uses":23},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92b6","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Source::Direct::CSRA Internal Mobility","color":null,"uses":39},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92c4","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Interviewer::Phone::Pradeep Chilka","color":null,"uses":17},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92c9","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Interviewer::In-person::Pradeep Chilka","color":null,"uses":23},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92cb","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Interviewer::In-person::Jylinda White","color":null,"uses":17},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92c6","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Interviewer::Phone::Jylinda White","color":null,"uses":2},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92cf","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Team::PACTS::Earth","color":null,"uses":2},{"id":"56bce1a6152c3f92fdf720ab","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Status: Onboarding","color":null,"uses":6},{"id":"56bce5bd152c3f92fdf73472","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"ReqID::6972","color":null,"uses":1},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92d1","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Team::PACTS::Fire","color":null,"uses":2}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/OWF7NoNB","subscribed":true,"url":"https://trello.com/c/OWF7NoNB/24-sra-todd-davis","attachments":[{"bytes":58898,"date":"2016-01-29T14:51:39.543Z","edgeColor":null,"idMember":"564349146656f8b20167c752","isUpload":true,"mimeType":null,"name":"Davis_Todd_Resume_SRA.docx","previews":[],"url":"https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/569431b6331b08db840f9293/56a8e65b873927f828876c9c/29c208a056cfcd41b011b60be032e2c9/Davis_Todd_Resume_SRA.docx","id":"56ab7c7bdd672f9956cadce7"},{"bytes":92160,"date":"2016-02-02T03:14:41.054Z","edgeColor":null,"idMember":"564349146656f8b20167c752","isUpload":true,"mimeType":null,"name":"Davis_Todd_Resume.doc","previews":[],"url":"https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/569431b6331b08db840f9293/56a8e65b873927f828876c9c/7f19334e53d48f02e7f957b6aba1cfbf/Davis_Todd_Resume.doc","id":"56b01f218523947f1f74f186"}]},{"id":"56a2b4ae43c11804bf873ccc","checkItemStates":null,"closed":true,"dateLastActivity":"2016-04-11T12:57:00.497Z","desc":"I am attaching the resume of Vennela Ippalapalli for BA position on PDAD.

Because the employees are looking at a 1/31 separation date, there is urgency to have managers review and interview them.\n\nRegards.\n\nSteve Averbach \nSenior Staffing Manager \nSRA International, Inc., A CSRA Company |www.csra.com\n3434 Washington Blvd. | Arlington, VA 22201\nPhone: 571.290.4235\nsteve_averbach@sra.com","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","idList":"56aa382688544d1358431550","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":11,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["569431b6331b08db840f92b6","569c17e1112cf4520c213f13","569431b6331b08db840f92a2","569431b6331b08db840f92cb","569431b6331b08db840f92c9","569431b6331b08db840f92c0","569431b6331b08db840f92c8"],"name":"(SRA) Ann Bitonti","pos":196607,"shortLink":"e4wudaIc","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":true,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":6,"checkItemsChecked":6,"comments":13,"attachments":1,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"pradeepchilka+53f48283f9a66d78300ddf0b+569c157c2cfba1848a5f2b38+f9d8029a8848e4dfe67ee3cbafb3daea69e4321d@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":["569fbf5f6b79eaf0ab18a8a5","56a28e09ce7bab67296af1c3"],"idMembers":["564349146656f8b20167c752","55db16a6567be917b91b8614","56532ede11c8b5f3a70ed781","561e85f60acefdca6a190656","53f48283f9a66d78300ddf0b","55306a3dd5c08210be8e93e9","55d395c1d173aded13b7b414"],"labels":[{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92b6","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Source::Direct::CSRA Internal Mobility","color":null,"uses":39},{"id":"569c17e1112cf4520c213f13","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Job::Senior Business Analyst","color":"purple","uses":16},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92a2","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Status::Rejected By Team","color":null,"uses":214},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92cb","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Interviewer::In-person::Jylinda White","color":null,"uses":17},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92c9","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Interviewer::In-person::Pradeep Chilka","color":null,"uses":23},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92c0","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Interviewer::Phone::Usha Krishnamurthy","color":null,"uses":19},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92c8","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Interviewer::Phone::Kishore Nakka","color":null,"uses":13}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/e4wudaIc","subscribed":true,"url":"https://trello.com/c/e4wudaIc/11-sra-ann-bitonti","attachments":[{"bytes":56413,"date":"2016-01-17T22:30:52.475Z","edgeColor":null,"idMember":"564349146656f8b20167c752","isUpload":true,"mimeType":null,"name":"Bitonti_Ann_Resume.docx","previews":[],"url":"https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/569431b6331b08db840f9293/569c157c2cfba1848a5f2b38/3422ac40cc1715e6482a1add16ff7e57/Bitonti_Ann_Resume.docx","id":"569c161cde06e37abc6e141b"}]},{"id":"56ba6dba17420b44e8f1861b","checkItemStates":null,"closed":true,"dateLastActivity":"2016-03-29T14:54:34.588Z","desc":"Java Developer and Scrum Master on the team at the Sustainment Program Application Support (SPAS) team from CSRA which is losing coverage in April.\n\nPAULA THRASHER\nSustainment Program Application Support (SPAS)\nProgram Manager\n\nCSC Government Solutions LLC, A CSRA Company\n50 F Street, NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20001\no: +1 202 654 7773 | m: 703 403 5980 | paula.thrasher@csra.com | www.csra.com\n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","idList":"56aa382688544d1358431550","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":74,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["56b39b00152c3f92fdd4f8d6","569431b6331b08db840f92b6","569c166ffb396fe70663dd00","56b8fff3152c3f92fde61be9","569431b6331b08db840f92be","56c1f54a152c3f92fd05a8fe","569431b6331b08db840f92a2"],"name":"(SRA) Soumya Kondapalli","pos":204799.75,"shortLink":"1rEAbWq3","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":true,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":10,"checkItemsChecked":7,"comments":13,"attachments":1,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"pradeepchilka+53f48283f9a66d78300ddf0b+56ba6dba17420b44e8f1861b+7e4f9f4937df9073ea6117aedc1261f4447beccb@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":["56ba6e472bc5e4233063e71b","56bdec3d7612f5afee4567f7","56cb757531240f06947b1684"],"idMembers":["564349146656f8b20167c752","55db16a6567be917b91b8614","5540e237796d69dcce7a8714","53f48283f9a66d78300ddf0b","56b22dd3cda2f35ca216bdb6","56b0cfe442c1913138996eb3"],"labels":[{"id":"56b39b00152c3f92fdd4f8d6","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Job::Java Developer -

However, I’m hoping that Samson’s body of work, including his experience as a Senior Process Manager that has given him incredible depth and breadth of exposure to managing project and focusing on process, and identifying and remediating issues, will warrant you considering him. \n  \nRegards. \n  \nSteve Averbach \n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","idList":"56aa382688544d1358431550","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":22,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["569431b6331b08db840f92b6","569c17adcfb933e454d81f1a","569c17c0074fd35d09b07394","569431b6331b08db840f92a2","569431b6331b08db840f92cb","569431b6331b08db840f92c9"],"name":"(SRA) Samson Selvaraj","pos":819199,"shortLink":"PbRVFxYK","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":true,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":3,"checkItemsChecked":3,"comments":6,"attachments":1,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"pradeepchilka+53f48283f9a66d78300ddf0b+56a784b84f3f0c6933aef6ed+05b11bfd2fb7518ee9a4be64b6ba4a9c80add3c1@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":["56a785818def27b721b83202"],"idMembers":["564349146656f8b20167c752","569905ae9d07922693d9d63d","55db16a6567be917b91b8614","55306a3dd5c08210be8e93e9","53f48283f9a66d78300ddf0b"],"labels":[{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92b6","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Source::Direct::CSRA Internal Mobility","color":null,"uses":39},{"id":"569c17adcfb933e454d81f1a","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Job::Process Analyst","color":"orange","uses":2},{"id":"569c17c0074fd35d09b07394","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Job::Process Lead","color":"orange","uses":1},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92a2","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Status::Rejected By Team","color":null,"uses":214},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92cb","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Interviewer::In-person::Jylinda White","color":null,"uses":17},{"id":"569431b6331b08db840f92c9","idBoard":"569431b6331b08db840f9293","name":"Interviewer::In-person::Pradeep Chilka","color":null,"uses":23}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/PbRVFxYK","subscribed":true,"url":"https://trello.com/c/PbRVFxYK/22-sra-samson-selvaraj","attachments":[{"bytes":270770,"date":"2016-01-26T14:39:03.533Z","edgeColor":null,"idMember":"564349146656f8b20167c752","isUpload":true,"mimeType":null,"name":"Selvaraj_Samson_Resume.pdf","previews":[],"url":"https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/569431b6331b08db840f9293/56a784b84f3f0c6933aef6ed/1ca969d58dc3dd8e54723fb146a7a13f/Selvaraj_Samson_Resume.pdf","id":"56a785072a01edc8dc3387cc"}]},{"id":"56afa5b4af63bb4e49d172cd","checkItemStates":null,"closed":true,"dateLastActivity":"2016-02-16T19:36:36.677Z","desc":"Adnan Alawneh has over 15 years of IT experience and over 10 years of IT leadership experience.\n\n•\tHe has over 10 years of System Architecture experience\n•\tHe has over 10 years of Enterprise Architecture experience\n•\tHe has of over 17 years of Java Development experience\n•\tHe is very conversant in .NET\n•\tHe has over 8 years of experience with AGILE/SAFe  \n•\tHe is very comfortable working with C-level folks and stakeholders\n•\tHe was personable in our conversation \n\n\nContact Number: 703-298-8341\nEmail Address: adnan.alawneh@csra.com\nBest Day/Time to Contact: flexible\nCurrent Home Location (City/metro area):Annandale, Va\nDesired Work Locations: Union Station is acceptable\nReason for looking: current commute is very difficult;
